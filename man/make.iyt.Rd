}
\arguments{
\item{loc.to.use}{REQUIRED is the name of the location useing hte code naem ie "crk"}

\item{loc.ids}{REQUIRED is a csv file with the first column being "loc.number"which is the zurn number for the location, the second column"location" is the full name of the locatoin, the third column has the codeded location name i.e. "crk" must match input to loc.to.use, the fourth column "beds" has the number of beds i.e. rows of that location}

\item{trial.ids}{REQUIRED is a csv file with teh first column "trial.number" has the trial id's fromt he zunr number,second column has the coded trail name i.e. "VT"}

\item{experiment}{REQUIRED is the name of the experiment you are making ie "VT" must match trail.ids coded name}

\item{entries}{REQUIRED is a csv file i.e.("18 VT 9jan18.csv") with one column "line" which has the list of the entries for the VT}

\item{plot.start}{OPTIONAL the number of the first plot i.e. 0 or 1 or 1000 which ever, Default is 1}

\item{number.blocks}{OPTIONALis the number of blocks to use i.e. 0 or 1 or 2 or 3. Defalut is 3}

\item{year}{REQUIRED is the year of the planting i.e. 2018}

\item{zurn.seed}{REQUIRED is the zurn code for the crop i.e. 5 for oat or 3 for barley}

\item{checks}{REQUIRED a csv file i.e.("18 VT 9jan18.csv") with one column "check" which has the list of the chekcs}

\description{
This is a wraper for FldTrial's design.rcbd fucntion, sepcificly for maing a standard IYT/AYT type trial, 
in a RCB design where within experiemnt fills are done with Checks , 
one set of checks per block
which may induce duplicaes witin blocks but makes for better planting files, 
adds functions to allow export of planting order and maps, 
it will also ad ZURN codes, and strips out uneeded extra columns, will also export a filed book type sheet for data collection.
}
\details{
This function allows you to make vt trials
