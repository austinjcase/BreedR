\title{Create an randomized complete block experiment.}
\usage{
make.rcbd(loc.to.use, loc.id, trial, trial.id, entries,
  plot.start = 1001, number.blocks = 3, num.beds, year, zurn.seed,
  checks, num.reps.chk = 1, fill.with = c("check", "entry", "filler"),
  write.excel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc.to.use}{The name of the location, writting as a three-letter (or more) code.}

\item{loc.id}{The two-digit zurn number for the location.}

\item{trial.id}{The two-digit zurn number for trial.}

\item{entries}{A csv file i.e.("18 VT 9jan18.csv") with one column "line" which has the list of the entries for the VT}

\item{plot.start}{The number of the first plot i.e. 0 or 1 or 1000 which ever, Default is 1001}

\item{number.blocks}{The number of blocks to use i.e. 0 or 1 or 2 or 3. Defalut is 3}

\item{num.beds}{The number of beds / field rows.}

\item{year}{The year of the planting.}

\item{zurn.seed}{The zurn code for the crop i.e. 5 for oat or 3 for barley}

\item{checks}{A csv file i.e.("18 VT 9jan18.csv") with one column "check" which has the list of the checks.}

\item{num.reps.chk}{The number of check replications. Default is 1.}

\item{fill.with}{A character determining what should fill empty plots. If "check," plots will be filled with checks; if "entry", plots will
be filled with entries; if "filler", plots will be filled with "FILLER"; alternatively, a custom string can be supplied (i.e. "RASMUSSEN").}

\item{write.excel}{Should the design and map files be exported to an .xlsx file? The name of the file will be "trial_year_loc_rand.xlsx"}

\item{trial.to.use}{The name of the trial.}
