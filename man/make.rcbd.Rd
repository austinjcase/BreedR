\title{Create experimental design randomizations}
\usage{
make.rcbd(location, location.id, trial, trial.id, entries, checks = NULL,
  plot.start = 1001, number.blocks = 3, number.rows, year, crop.id,
  number.reps.chk = 1, fill.with = c("check", "entry", "filler"),
  write.excel = FALSE)

make.aibd(location, location.id, trial, trial.id, entries,
  plot.start = 1, minimum.blocks = 6, number.rows, year, crop.id,
  checks, chk2rep = 3, fill.with = c("check", "entry", "filler"),
  write.excel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{The name of the location, writting as a three-letter (or more) code.}

\item{location.id}{The two-digit zurn number for the location.}

\item{trial}{The name of the trial.}

\item{trial.id}{The two-digit zurn number for trial.}

\item{entries}{A csv file i.e.("18 VT 9jan18.csv") with one column "line" which has the list of the entries for the VT}

\item{checks}{A csv file i.e.("18 VT 9jan18.csv") with one column "check" which has the list of the checks.}

\item{plot.start}{The number of the first plot i.e. 0 or 1 or 1000 which ever, Default is 1001}

\item{number.blocks}{The number of blocks to use i.e. 0 or 1 or 2 or 3. Defalut is 3. For an RCBD, this is also the number of replications.}

\item{number.rows}{The number of beds / field rows.}

\item{year}{The year of the planting.}

\item{crop.id}{The zurn code for the crop i.e. 5 for oat or 3 for barley}

\item{number.reps.chk}{The number of check replications. Default is 1.}

\item{fill.with}{A character determining what should fill empty plots. If "check," plots will be filled with checks; if "entry", plots will
be filled with entries; if "filler", plots will be filled with "FILLER"; alternatively, a custom string can be supplied (i.e. "RASMUSSEN").}

\item{write.excel}{Should the design and map files be exported to an .xlsx file? The name of the file will be "trial_year_loc_rand.xlsx"}

\item{minimum.blocks}{The minimum number of incomplete blocks. Defalut is 6}

\item{chk2rep}{The number of replications of the secondary check. Default is 3.}
