\title{Calculate adjusted means from a single trial}
\usage{
fit_stage_one(data, checks, fixed = ~-1 + line + checks, random = ~row
  + column + blk, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame with at least the following information: trait name, genotype name, and the trait value. Other
columns must be included if specified in models}

\item{checks}{A vector of genotype names to serve as checks. If not provided, any line that is replicated will be a check.}

\item{fixed}{A formula specifying fixed effects.}

\item{random}{A formula specifying random effects.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level at which to remove random effects during backwards elimination.}
}
\description{
Perform the first step of two-step phenotypic analysis, where genotype means are first
calculated on a per-trial basis, then analysis is performed using data across all trials.
