# Introduction

Welcome to the `BreedR` package. This package is designed to provide functions for manipulating and analyzing data in the
barley and oat breeding programs at the University of Minnesota. 

This vignette will provide some example workflows and outline the capabilities of this package. It is divided into three 
sections: **Designing Trials**, **Writing to the Database**, and **Analyzing Data**.

First, load the package using the standard R notation:

```{r load}
library(BreedR)
```
